## Auditing
To perform auditing, select: **Reports -> Current Group Audit -> Order**, where order is the order you would like them printed out.

The values on the audit report are the **RAW** times plus any cones and gates. These values should match the raw values
on the timing card. For each person, verify all of their times with the audit report. If something doesn't match up,
you will need to determine which value is wrong and correct it.
