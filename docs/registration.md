# Configuring Label Printer

By default, the label printer will use about 4" of label material for each label printed.  This can only be changed in the local printing preferences itself.  If it is not already setup:

1. Right click on the printer and select "Printing Preferences" (Windows 7)

![PrinterMenu](images/printer.png)

2. In the preferences dialog, change the Length field, we currently use 2.3".

# Tasha's FAQ's

1. If an entrant is registered for two classes at the same event, <class> and TOPM, and it is the AM session where <class> is running, does registration need to do anything to make sure the entrant's <class> entry info is used first?

    * No, if multiple cars are registered, TOPM is only used once all other cars have been used in other run groups.  Data Entry can also override if they need to.

2. If an entrant is running <class> and also registered for TOPM, but <class> runs PM so the TOPM entry isn't allowed/needed. What does registration need to do to make sure the correct entry is used in this situation?

    * Nothing is required; however, you can unregister the TOPM if you wish.

3. For an entrant who is correctly pre-registered for AM and PM and has no changes, does registration need to do anything besides verify entry info and make sure the entrant has a barcode?

    * No, they are ready to go
